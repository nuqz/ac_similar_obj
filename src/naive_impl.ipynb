    "An image with a size of `552x344` is given, which depicts several (possible always 7) objects. These objects can be three-dimensional letters, numbers or stereometric shapes. Objects may have different colors. There are 2 similar objects in the image, i.e. two identical letters, numbers or shapes. Other objects differ in shape. The task is to use the mouse to indicate the approximate coordinates of the centers of these two similar objects.\n",
